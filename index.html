          the dream to have your own website. I can build your website hosting a
          server and using HTML, CSS (and JavaScript - this probably will be
          latter). We can start getting in contact by a e-mail, text message or
          chat! Just let me know what is your name and the kind of business you
          do. next we will start planning the site you want and the times I will
          be showing you how the site goes on. At the same time when planning we
          will decide the amount you are going to pay for the site.

            How much it cost to have a website?
          </h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-3">
            There is a big cost variety around the world about the website
            costs, it shouldnâ€™t be expansive if you have a small business You
            can create your own website with some DIY website maker and pay it
            monthly, or... you can be the owner of your own website and get new
            customers which is very hard to do with DIY websites. Anyway, the
            cost it depends on how many pages your website is going to be and
            the complexity of each one, you can go to the coitizes price to
            estimate an amount of cost.

          The world changes, moves on and keep going forward. This is due to
          individual and colective sacrifice. Are you gonna stay without moving
          on? Someone could thought that himself or herself cann't do not change
          the world, but each effort makes it changing. it is up to you if this
          change is gonna be for a little more good.

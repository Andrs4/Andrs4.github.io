        <p>I arrived to Peru on May-02-2017 my birthday, it was one of the best
            birthday's gifts I got. My Mission President and his wife were President and 
            Sister Herrera from Tacna-Peru, I can describe how many things I learned form and
            with them.</p>

        <p>I was assigned to serve on Puno-Peru, My trainer was Elder Galvis from Manizales-
            Colombia, It was a very good time to learn to talk to everyone and work really
            hard with the Holy gosth, does first experiences helped me to trust on God's will, 
            and to be happy.

        <p>I had been on 6 different cities and with 12 different companions, one of my 
            favorites was Quillabamba, I loved that place, because the preparation and desire 
            to recieve the gospel in their lives. The weather and its panoram was awesome too.

        <p>I know that God wants us to give our very best while doing anything we are doing,
            but most when we are doing his will. He calls us and he prepares us to do his will
            we only need to have a willingness heart and mind. One step at a time.
